# Rhythm Game Info

This is a test Vite + React + TypeScript project for looking through songs from Chunithm, a japanese rhythm game

# TODO

1. ~~Add more filters when searching~~
2. ~~Add randomizer option to select any amount of songs~~ Changed to align with course mode
3. Put data into database and call it rather than using data.tsx
4. Add images to the data
5. Make it mobile friendly (only works well in desktop right now)
6. Possibly add more songs on different games
7. Try to make all the song titles to English (yay....)
